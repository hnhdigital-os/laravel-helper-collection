============

First off - **you rock!**, thanks you so much for taking to time and energy to make this project better!

A healthy community is filled with different coders with differnt coding styles. This can cause cognative friction. 
Here are a few rules to follow in order to minimize that friction and ease code reviews and discussions before 
maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/). Use
[PHP-CS-Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to make this task easier if you are unfamiliar with these stantards.
Additionally you:
# MUST run the test suite.
# MUST write (or update) unit tests.
# SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before submitting your Pull Request.

You may be asked to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`,
`fix 3`, etc).

Let's do this!
